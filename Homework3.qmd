## Task 1

### Question 1

```{r}
?read_csv
```

We cannot use read_csv specifically because our delimiter for the given data is a semicolon, not a comma. There is another function described in the help file called read_csv2 which uses the semicolon as a field separator, which we will need to use for the data.

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/ST558/Homework3/data")
data <- read_csv2("data.txt")
data
```

### Question 2

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/ST558/Homework3/data")
data2 <- read_delim("data2.txt", delim = '6', col_types = "fdc")
data2
```
